Entities:
1.	Admin/User – Registers employees, marks attendance, views records, and downloads reports.
2.	Attendance Management System – The system that stores, updates, and manages employee data.
3.	Employees – Users whose attendance is tracked and managed.
Processes:
•	Register Employee: Admin adds employee details.
•	Mark Attendance: Attendance is recorded.
•	View Attendance Report: Users can view/download reports.
Diagram Explanation:
•	The Admin/User interacts with the Attendance Management System to register employees, mark attendance, view records, and download reports.
•	The system stores employee details and updates attendance records.
•	Employees interact indirectly, as their attendance data is updated by the system.

At Level 1, we break the system into individual processes.
Processes & Data Flow:
1. Employee Registration
•	Input: Admin enters Employee ID, Name, and Email.
•	Process: Data is validated and stored in the Employee Database.
•	Output: Employee is successfully registered.
2. Mark Attendance
•	Input: Admin selects an employee and marks attendance.
•	Process: Updates the Attendance Database with "Present" or "Absent" status.
•	Output: Attendance is recorded.
3. View Attendance List
•	Input: User requests the attendance list.
•	Process: System fetches records from the Attendance Database.
•	Output: Displays attendance records.
4. Download Report
•	Input: User clicks the "Download Report" button.
•	Process: System generates a CSV report containing employee attendance details.
•	Output: A CSV file is downloaded.
